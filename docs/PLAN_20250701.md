# Engineering Roadmap: WhisperLite - 2025-07-01

This document outlines the current state of the WhisperLite project, identifies missing pieces, and provides a prioritized roadmap for the next phase of development.

## 1. Overview

WhisperLite is a local-first, real-time speech transcription tool for desktop. It uses a hybrid Rust-Python-Tauri architecture to capture audio, transcribe it using a local `whisper.cpp` model, and display the live transcript in a floating overlay window. Its primary use case is to provide a lightweight, private, and readily accessible transcription service for users on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## ✅ 2. Completed Work

Based on the existing codebase and documentation, the following features and modules are considered complete and functional:

## 4. Known Issues or Risk Areas

-   **Fragile Logic**: The communication between the Rust and Python processes relies on `stdin`/`stdout`. This can be brittle, especially if the Python process crashes or fails to start. More robust error handling and process monitoring are needed.
-   **Missing Error Handlers**: The Python code lacks comprehensive `try...except` blocks, particularly around file I/O (`output_writer.py`) and model loading (`transcriber.py`).
-   **Unclear Module Responsibilities**: The division of responsibilities between `main.py` and `ui_controller.py` could be clearer. Refactoring may be needed to create a more defined service layer.
-   **Platform-Specific Gaps**: Linux packaging is often more complex than Windows and macOS. Ensuring compatibility across various distributions (e.g., Fedora, Arch) will require additional testing and potentially different packaging strategies.

This action plan is prioritized to address the most critical gaps first.

### Milestone 3: Expand Functionality (3-4 weeks)

| Task                                      | Files/Modules Involved                               | Complexity | GitHub Issue |

## 6. Engineering Notes

-   **Design Choices**: The hybrid Rust-Python architecture is a smart choice for balancing performance (Rust for audio I/O) and ease of use (Python for ML). However, it introduces complexity at the boundary between the two languages.
-   **Future Contributor Trip-ups**: New contributors may find it challenging to debug the communication between the Rust and Python processes. A detailed guide on this topic would be highly beneficial.
-   **Clean and Reusable Parts**: The `transcriber.py` and `transcript_buffer.py` modules are well-defined and could be easily reused in other projects.
-   **Refactoring Opportunities**: The `main.py` file could be refactored to better separate concerns. A dedicated service layer could handle the communication with the Rust process, while the `main` function would only be responsible for parsing arguments and starting the application.
